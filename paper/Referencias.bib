The “minimization” is achieved by repetitively evaluating a nonlinear set of equations. Imbedded in the process is a random or Monte Carlo selection of assignments. As in such heuristic techniques, the solution may not be optimum and many solutions may be found which yield locally minimal results. Computer programs are described and empirical results given.},

Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

abstract = "In this paper, we approach the Examination-Timetabling Problem (ETP) from a student-centric point of view. We allow for multiple versions of an exam to be scheduled to increase the spreading of exams for students. We propose two Column Generation (CG) algorithms. In the first approach, a column is defined as an exam schedule for every unique student group, and a Pricing Problem (PPs) is developed to generate these columns. The Master Program (MP) then selects an exam schedule for every unique student group. Instead of using branch-and-price, we heuristically select columns. In the second approach, a column consists of a mask schedule for every unique student group, and a PP is developed to generate the masks. The MP then selects the masks and schedules exams in the mask slots. We compare both models and perform a computational experiment. We solve the ETP at KU Leuven campus Brussels (Belgium) for the business engineering degree program and apply the models to two existing datasets from the literature."

Various constraints regarding room utilization and time restrictions for certain examinations can be taken into account. The program is efficient and reliable. It is accessed through a simple and comprehensive input routine. The output provides enough information to enable the user to make changes by hand if necessary. The implementation of the program in a business school is described."

A large number of variants of the timetabling problem have been proposed in the literature, which differ from each other based on the type of institution involved (university or school) and the type of constraints. This problem, that has been traditionally considered in the operational research field, has recently been tackled with techniques belonging also to Artificial Intelligence (e.g., genetic algorithms, tabu search, and constraint satisfaction).

In this paper, we apply these four techniques and three novel hybrid combinations of them to a classical Examination Timetabling problem (ETP), an NP complete problem. The novel hybrid algorithms consist of a Sequential TS–ACS, a Hybrid ACS/TS, and a Sequential ACS–TS algorithms. These various hybrid combinations are then tested on 10 different scenarios of the classical ETP. Statistical comparative analysis conclude that all of the three proposed novel techniques are significantly better than each of their non-hybrid competitors, and furthermore the Sequential ACS–TS provides the superior solution of all."

abstract = "The university examination timetabling problem is one of challenging optimization problems. Its NP-hard nature makes this problem attractive to be studied, especially in the field of operation research and artificial intelligence. In the literature, the state-of-the-art approach for solving examination timetabling problem is meta-heuristics. However, this approach has limitation, i.e. the need for intensive problem-specific parameter tuning. To cope with this problem, a relatively new approach namely hyper-heuristics was proposed. Different from meta-heuristics that search upon solution space, hyper-heuristics search upon low-level space. This strategy makes hyper-heuristics more generic that works over cross-domain, compared to meta-heuristics that usually designed for specific problem domain. This paper reports the success of solving real-world university examination timetabling problem in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember using hyper-heuristics based on great deluge algorithm. The main contributions of this study are two folds: a new dataset and new approach for solving examination timetabling problem. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm could produce much better solutions compared to the solutions generated manually. In addition, the proposed algorithm also outperforms two benchmarking algorithms, namely hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms."

abstract = "Educational timetabling is an ongoing challenging administrative task that is required in most academic institutions. This is mainly due to a large number of constraints and requirements that have to be satisfied. Educational timetabling problems have been classified as NP-hard problems and can be divided into three types: exam timetabling, course timetabling and high school timetabling. The domain of high school timetabling is not well developed when compared to other fields of educational timetabling such as university exam timetabling and course timetabling. As the evolution of the educational systems are continuous, new challenges often arise, requiring new models and solution methodologies. Over the years, a number of methodologies have been developed to address high school timetabling problems. However, there are no comparative studies or rigorous analysis of these methodologies. This survey paper aims to provide a scientific review of high school timetabling. The paper presents a categorisation of the methodologies conducted in recent years based on chronology, category and application (dataset). We first present comparative studies on the success of proposed methodologies. The components and mechanisms of different methodologies are analysed and compared. We also discuss their performance, advantages, disadvantages and potential for improvement. Methodology wise, a shift of popularity from meta-heuristic to mathematical optimisation is observed in recent years. Another observation is that more researchers are opting for XHSTT formatted datasets as a testbed for their algorithms. Finally, we outline the industrial perspective, trends and future direction in high school timetabling optimisation problems."

abstract="It has frequently been reported that pure genetic algorithms for graph colouring are in general outperformed by more conventional methods. There is every reason to believe that this is mainly due to the choice of an unsuitable encoding of solutions. Therefore, an alternative representation, based on the grouping character of the graph colouring problem, was chosen. Furthermore, a fitness function defined on the set of partitions of vertices, guiding the Grouping Genetic Algorithm well in the search, was developed. This algorithm has been applied to a choice of hard-to-colour graph examples, with good results. It has also been extended to the application to real-world timetabling problems. As a by-product, phase transition regions of a class of randomly generated graphs have been located.",

It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

Building on the heuristic ordering technique, where events are ordered by decreasing scheduling difficulty, the neural network allows a novel dynamic, multi-criteria approach to be developed. The difficulty of each event to be scheduled is assessed on several characteristics, removing the dependence of an ordering based on a single heuristic. Furthermore, this technique allows the ordering to be reviewed and modified as each event is scheduled; a necessary step since the timetable and constraints are altered as events are placed. Our approach uses a Kohonen self organising neural network and is shown to have wide applicability. Results are presented for a range of examination timetabling problems using standard benchmark datasets.",

We allow for multiple versions of an exam to be scheduled to increase the spreading of exams for students. We propose two Column Generation (CG) algorithms. In the first approach, a column is defined as an exam schedule for every unique student group, and a Pricing Problem (PPs) is developed to generate these columns. The Master Program (MP) then selects an exam schedule for every unique student group. Instead of using branch-and-price, we heuristically select columns. In the second approach, a column consists of a mask schedule for every unique student group, and a PP is developed to generate the masks. The MP then selects the masks and schedules exams in the mask slots. We compare both models and perform a computational experiment. We solve the ETP at KU Leuven campus Brussels (Belgium) for the business engineering degree program and apply the models to two existing datasets from the literature."

abstract = "Simulated Annealing (SA), Tabu Search (TS), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Ant Colony System (ACS) are four of the main algorithms for solving challenging problems of intelligent systems. In this paper, we apply these four techniques and three novel hybrid combinations of them to a classical Examination Timetabling problem (ETP), an NP complete problem. The novel hybrid algorithms consist of a Sequential TS–ACS, a Hybrid ACS/TS, and a Sequential ACS–TS algorithms. These various hybrid combinations are then tested on 10 different scenarios of the classical ETP. Statistical comparative analysis conclude that all of the three proposed novel techniques are significantly better than each of their non-hybrid competitors, and furthermore the Sequential ACS–TS provides the superior solution of all."

abstract = "This paper is concerned with the development of an examination scheduling system that is sufficiently flexible to deal with the many different objectives and constraints found across a broad spectrum of universities and colleges. The problem is solved in two phases using simulated annealing. The first phase seeks out a feasible solution and the second finds an improvement in terms of meeting the secondary objectives and soft constraints. As the quality of a simulated annealing solution is known to depend on the parameters used to control the algorithm and the way in which the problem is modelled within the simulated annealing framework a successful implemetation relies on judicious choices in both areas. A number of different choices are suggested and compared using a test-bed of problems derived from data from a variety of institutions. The final result is a robust system that is capable of dealing with a wide range of problem specifications and data characteristics. The examination scheduling problem varies in detail from institution to institution. Thus any generic approach must be robust enough to work well over the full spectrum of problem characteristics. It is well-known that the quality of solutions produced by any simulated annealing implementation depends on the correct choice of solution space and neighbourhood, as well as the parameters that govern the cooling schedule. As these choices are sensitive to the precise problem details the design of a generic simulated annealing based approach to examination scheduling needs to address this issue carefully. This paper examines this problem with respect to an implementation that has already been shown to work well at a single institution. The basic framework is used to test different neighbourhoods and cooling schedules over a variety of problems and to examine whether or not biases in sampling have a significant effect on solution quality. The results indicate that the choice of neighbourhood is the most important decision and that neighbourhoods based on the graph-theoretic concept of Kempe chains are the most effective regardless of the objectives or size of the problem."

abstract = "The university examination timetabling problem is one of challenging optimization problems. Its NP-hard nature makes this problem attractive to be studied, especially in the field of operation research and artificial intelligence. In the literature, the state-of-the-art approach for solving examination timetabling problem is meta-heuristics. However, this approach has limitation, i.e. the need for intensive problem-specific parameter tuning. To cope with this problem, a relatively new approach namely hyper-heuristics was proposed. Different from meta-heuristics that search upon solution space, hyper-heuristics search upon low-level space. This strategy makes hyper-heuristics more generic that works over cross-domain, compared to meta-heuristics that usually designed for specific problem domain. This paper reports the success of solving real-world university examination timetabling problem in Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember using hyper-heuristics based on great deluge algorithm. The main contributions of this study are two folds: a new dataset and new approach for solving examination timetabling problem. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm could produce much better solutions compared to the solutions generated manually. In addition, the proposed algorithm also outperforms two benchmarking algorithms, namely hill climbing and simulated annealing algorithms."
